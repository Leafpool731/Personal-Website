                            Let it be known, that by the covenant of his words, that by decree, within this poetic tail, tells the story in which my life is seen through. 
                            Through the looking glass of my conscience, may you peer into my own reality, and only for a moment. 
                            Within the grace and time that I have taken to present to you the story of my own world. 
                            Please, respect in the fact that this isn’t your typical tall tale, or fantasy. 
                            Far from. Please, relax, enjoy. Let tranquility take you away… into the momentous world in which you have now stepped foot in.

                            Do you know… do you know what darkness is? 
                            The wretched word that spills off the tongue, gives way to all fear and all horrors beyond any imagination. 
                            Do you know what that means? Do you know what it really means? 
                            I have seen it, breathed it, been face to face with the darkness. 
                            The darkness is not a simple thing that exists, no, it is something much more. 
                            Full of life, full of hell… such beauty that set me free, oh that darkness. 
                            Sets me free, keeps me captive, isn’t it intricate? … Would you like to meet the darkness? 
                            Hear the story of how I did? I shall tell you, but only in a hushed whisper. 
                            You must keep this only between us, unless you too, wish to become like me. 
                            Do you understand? This is a secret, meant for you and me. Just us. Just us.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The night was cold; cold and dark; 
                            cold like the sharpest word thrown from an angered wife onto her husband, and dark like the cosmos that lay above me, like the shadows that played around me. 
                            The moon that shone above through a translucent veil of thunder clouds, gave only little moonlight, only little hope. 
                            The light that did filter through the barred glass window lay over me, much like a blanket, in a shallow and icy way. 
                            I lay on the mattress that had been given to me, it’s iron springs piercing my back like a torture device one would find in a lonesome dungeon. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The sadness in the atmosphere was almost drowning. 
                            There was no essence of life, so sign of another soul. Nothing existed here but me. 
                            Me and the emptiness. Me…  and the darkness. 
                            The loneliness ate away at my soul, like a slow toxin, deep within my heart, leaving nothing but a dark hole in its wake. 
                            There was nothing to distract me from the thoughts that loomed over my head, danced about my skull. 
                            There was nothing here. It was desolate. I was desolate. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A small rumble sounded from the heavens, and the sound of gentle, delicate raindrops on the concrete outside broke the silence of the night. 
                            I turned onto my back, and looked out the window at the rain. It was so elegant, so beautiful. 
                            I could feel the cosmos unite with my emptiness as each drop pelted the window. A reminder that even God cries too, that the universe has miserable moments as well. 
                            The clouds above slowly began to swirl and shift, the rain began to fall harder against the glass pain. 
                            Each crack of thunder boomed and echoed around me in the empty home, yet within these loud shouts from the world above, I heard something odd. 
                            A small, near silent sound of something ominous, something different than wind or rain. It was faint, yet notably existent. 
                            With each thread of light that jumped from the sky, I could hear it. Something ancient. Something wrong. Something… alive…. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            From the depths of the primordial castle, it came, shattering the silence more loudly than any rumble of thunder or the crashing winds from outside. 
                            Two, perfectly in sync, footprints. They climbed the concrete stairs quickly, furiously, and with an anger that could only be described as detrimental. 
                            They sounded their presence loudly, and whomever it was, wherever they were coming from, they were coming for me. Anxiously, I waited as they approached. 
                            There was nothing I could do, nowhere I could hide from this impending presence, I was alone, with it. 
                            Just me and the footsteps, just me and the paranoia. The sounds quickened, I could hear breathing in an intense, almost inhuman way. 
                            My heart raced faster than even the lightning outside. 
                            I sat, alert, rigid, as the thunder outside seemed to crash more furiously, and the winds that were simply gentle breezes from before quickened into harsh, ravenous gusts. 
                            Then, with a large flash of light from outside, it appeared, in front of my cell. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It stood, ominously, simply staring into the cage. 
                            It had the form vaguely that of a man, yet there was no face to be seen. 
                            There was nothing to be seen of the dark black figure other than its two pin-like, sharp white eyes. 
                            They pierced my skin as the creature peared into my soul. It simply stared at me, as the storm raged on. 
                            Then, without warning, it slowly started to gape its mouth. The creaking noise that emerged from it, gave way to only absolute terror. 
                            It’s voice, its sound, was of like nothing I had ever heard. It made my ears both ring in agony from it’s high shrill, and want to go towards it, as if it’d bring me hope. 
                            Yet, the darkness that it was made of could never bring me hope. 
                            Clasping my ears, I try to resist, yet its song, like that of a siren, only caused my soul to wish to go to it further. 
                            The storm outside raging further and further, lighting struck faster and faster, as I try to keep myself from this creatures spell. 
                            Then, with an almost blinding crack of light from above, and an immortal rumble of thunder, the creature vanished, leaving nothing but silence in its wake.
                            I look to the window and nothing but the vibrant moon and gentle stars shown. 
                            There was no rain, no storm. Simple emptiness. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I stand, slowly and nervously, my body shaking furiously from what I had just witnessed. 
                            Timidly, I stepped softly to the barred door that kept me trapped in here. 
                            I stared at the door, looking to see if anything had changed, if any molecule of rust had disappeared or moved. 
                            Yet all was the same. The same, except for one, small detail. 
                            I gently grasped the bar to hold, to keep my body from succumbing to the anxiety and confusion inside of me. 
                            Yet, instead of standing like a metal wall that only the touch of an angel could open, the door slowly opened, letting out a moan of rusted gears grinding on one another.
                                I stood in astonishment. Had that creature, that seemingly so desperately wanted my soul for its own, set me free? 
                                I hesitantly place my foot outside the perimeters of my cage onto the cold concrete. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The air was frigid outside my old room, and I shivered greatly, both from the cold and my nerves, as I peered around the room that my eyes hadn’t seen in many moons. 
                            The room was empty, nothing but a concrete box that held only a few cells and a small stone bench, all vacant. 
                            There were streams of mold where water was leaking from the rusted pipes above. 
                            The only light that was able to filter through into the cold and empty space was from the windows that were locked behind bars.
                                Cautiously, I took another few steps, and noticed a few hallways that stemmed from both the left and the right. 
                                They both were dark and foreboding, filled with nothing but shadows. Yet there was something surprising about the left one. 
                                Deep within the belly of darkness, stood two small, yet familiar, white eyes. My heart began to race lightly. 
                                It stood silently, down the long dark hallway, and made no movements…  no sounds. We simply stared at one another, again. 
                                I could feel the fear rise in me the longer I stood. I wanted to run in the other direction, yet found myself frozen, fixated on the creature. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Suddenly, from behind me, a small, aggressive noise emerged. I felt my back stand straight with tension. 
                            I couldn’t look away from the creature, and now, someone else, something else was approaching me. 
                            I was trapped. The noise from behind me grew louder, frantic, fast. It was sprinting towards me. 
                            I wanted to hide. There was no hope. If I was to die, I was to die here, between the dark and the unknown. 
                            The sound, now sounded more like footsteps. I could hear them, each pace coming closer by the second. 
                            I felt my heart race in beat to echoing song of running. 
                            Frantically, I panicked, and let my head swing for a moment behind me to witness what was coming for me. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There was nothing. 
                            My eyes were met with the empty hallway, illuminated only by a few small windows. 
                            In its place, was a tune, happy and light, filled with notes of trumpets, saxophones, and cellos. 
                            I turn confused, yet quickly to where the creature once stood, only to find that it too had disappeared. 
                            I take a few steps in each direction. I was once again, alone. The room was empty and void of all living existence except for me. 
                            The music floated lightly around the room, something that made my ears happy. I walked towards it, out of the icy common room. 
                            I headed down the small hallway that the noise seemingly originated from. 
                            The short passageway turned, and opened to a long, bright corridor. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It had the style of ancient architecture, with a high, pointed ceiling, and large window panes of stained glass. 
                            The ceiling was made up of a deep brown and rustic style wood, while the floors and walls were made up of medieval cobble, different from the rest of the concrete manor. 
                            The moonlight that passed through the windows shown onto the floor with a bright array of colours. 
                            I took a small step forward, into the hallway, placing my foot within the beautiful rainbows. 
                            With each step I took, the magic in the air rose, as the music grew louder with more melodies being added. 
                            I pass the first glass mural. It was an ancient cherry tree, delicately designed by a master craftsman. 
                            The leaves that hung on the art, weren’t leaves at all, but rather gentle and fragrant flowers. 
                            Their petals flew in the breeze all, showing the new season of spring. It was beautiful. 
                            I took a few more steps, and then stopped to look at the second glass pane. It was of now a hardy birch tree, tall and thin, with striking white bark. 
                            The leaves and scene were designed with brilliant greens, and a gorgeous sun illuminating the art. The season of summer. 
                            I could hardly remember the warmth of those months, I had lived in the cold for so long. 
                            I continue on my stroll down the hallway, the magic in the air increased as I passed the final mural. 
                            There, depicted in the glass, was an old and timeless oak tree. 
                            Standing within a large field, it’s wide branches held all the leaves of red and brown. 
                            The colours were reminiscent of only one season; Autumn. 
                            I take in the vibrant colours for a moment before looking away and towards the end of the hallway.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My eyes were met with the most colourful array of dresses and gowns I had ever seen in my life. 
                            My skin could feel the warmth of the party going on. 
                            It made my heart lift, and my face smile for the first time in years. 
                            I walked, slowly, to simply take in the full spectrum of magic found within the hallway. 
                            The music was more vibrant than ever, matching to the pace of my footsteps. 
                            It was beautiful. Yet, there was something odd about the song that played. 
                            Deep, within the notes of the bass, came something familiar. The sound, of another's footsteps, once more. 
                            They were deep, heavy, full of an emotion I couldn’t place my finger on. 
                            I could feel myself grow anxious again, my heart start to race. 
                            Yet the magic of the corridor, and the swing of violins and jazz slowly made my heart beat not out of worry, but out of happiness. 
                            I paced right up to the entrance of the room, and  watched. There were couples, dancers, every type of person, all in one room. 
                            I had never seen so many souls in one place at once. 
                            Is this where everyone has been hiding? 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            From the right, came a couple, more vibrant than the rest. 
                            The wife wore a brilliant maroon dress, draped in the finest jewels and gold. 
                            Her black hair was up in a wondrous bun, and her smile… her smile was familiar. 
                            She danced with a tall man with locks and curls all shades of brown. He stood proudly as he spun her around. 
                            As the paraded around the room, I noticed something familiar. The womans face, her smile, her hair, her sharp green eyes. 
                            They were… mine. She… was myself, in a better world, in a better place. In a better time, before this. 
                            The man, swiftly let her down for a low dip, then raised her up for a tight spin. 
                            Their laughs echoed down the hallway as they danced. They were so perfectly in sync with the music. 
                            Just like my heart. Just like the deep footsteps. 
                            My mind raced with the realization that the bass had grown louder, and along with it, the sound of gloomy feet. 
                            I tried to enter the room, yet all of the physical world would not let me. There was a barrier to the room, something invisible. 
                            I pressed my hands against the scene, yet they could not pass, and instead only traced the outlines of rustic bricks and mortar. 
                            I gaze, wide eyed at the scene. Life would not let me enter. I scrutinize at the dancers as they all slowed to the music that was steadily fading away. 
                            The last note rang, and the party ceased for a moment. The couple that stood ahead of me turned to face me, as the footsteps behind me once again started to race in a raging way. 
                            I cried, begged to the wall. Please! The couple simply looked at me, with no worry in their faces. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            “Are you alright?” She asked, as a crowd of people started to form around her, all looking at me, confused and fascinated. 
                            As the words rolled off her tongue, I could feel it. I slowly peered over my shoulder.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            With a robe made of searing thistle, it captured me, quicker than anything in the universe. 
                            It pulled me from my feet to the ground, dragging me along the ancient floor, which caused my back to ache in pain. 
                            The noise that the creatured produced caused my ears to ring and the lonesome glass panels to shatter, in an array of rainbow shards all over me, piercing my skin as my body ran over them. 
                            I screamed and cried into the hallway, but the room that lay at the end was no longer there, there was no one to save me. 
                            I placed my hands along the walls of the hallway, gripping to the sides, but the noose around my neck only grew tighter as I resisted. 
                            My eyes began to tear, as the fear inside of me surmounted, my heart racing beyond control. There was no escape from this.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The creature furiously opened a door at the other end of the hallway, where I started from, and brought me inside. 
                            There was nothing but a single glass mural and a hook. The creature strung me up quickly and swiftly. 
                            The hook that my neck was now bound to was cold and rusted, sending chills down my spine. 
                            I flailed in mid air, frantically, yet every move I made, made the noose around my neck tighten more. 
                            I cried harder. I was filled with dismay, filled with fear, filled with something. 
                            I looked to the glass mural that stood to the side, letting in only a sliver of light. 
                            It was designed with a bare tree, standing among tufts of white. Winter, the season of death and despair. 
                            The creature bound my hands and feet with more of the stinging rope, then took a step back to look at me. Somewhere in its beady white eyes, I was sure the feeling of immense pride was gleaming. 
                            It had found me, lured me, and now trapped me, forever to do it’s bidding. 
                            I looked down at it, tears blurring my vision, and simply watched as it opened its old, ancient mouth once more, and produced its god awful sound. 
                            My ears, too numb to hear, no longer rang at the painful shriek. 
                            Slowly, as if to prolong my experience, it’s head slowly rose to meet my own, and we looked at each other. 
                            Its smell was that of a corpse, with strong chemicals placed within it, to try and preserve its body. 
                            We stared at one another, as we had so many times before. We stared, as if we knew one another. 
                            Then, from within it’s dark figure I saw a man. A man so faded, so corrupted by the darkness that his soul knew nothing of the light. 
                            A man that seemed familiar, as if I had seen him before. He had the same hair, the same face as the man that had danced in the room. 
                            He touched me, softly, gently, as if it was trying to comfort me from all the pain that I had endured. I let him. He caressed me, much as a lover would do for a wife;  
                            gently prying my head away from my neck, to expose the entirety of it. With a soft, yet delicate motion, he kissed my neck, daintily. 
                            Then, within an instant, a searing pain arose from the spot in which he placed his lips. 
                            I could feel my own blood trickle down my neck, and a poison rush through my veins, surging through my body. 
                            I screamed in pain, as it repeatedly sank it’s shart, claw like teeth into my neck. 
                            I could feel my body growing colder, as my blood began to drip past my fingertips, landing on the floor underneath me. 
                            Then, with a final bite that consumed the entirety of my neck, my soul, my life, was given to the darkness. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="em-text"> 
                            Why do you look so afraid? Did my story scare you that much? What is it, why are you looking at me like that? 
                            Please, no, don’t be afraid… come back! I said come back here right now! 
                            Oh you imbecile, I’ll get you! Your precious light can’t save you now! Did you think that you can really hear the story of how I was turned and get away with it? 
                            No, I must continue this long legacy. Who did you think you were talking to? A friend? An angel? Oh silly you… 
                            You’ve been talking to me… You’ve been talking to the darkness… And there’s no escaping me.
