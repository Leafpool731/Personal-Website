                        The night was bitter and cold; waves covered my feet with sharply frigid waters. A star-filled sky flowed before me, like an endless black blanket. 
                        The air was silent, with no sounds of life other than my own. I wonder if that night was like this, 
                        this empty when everything changed in our lives -- when she removed herself from my life. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I remember the autumn night that the news had finally reached my ears of what had happened to her. 
                        The way they found her, mangled amongst the dead leaves and wet sand; the foamed, peaceful lake waves washing over her cold ankles, just like they do mine now. 
                        I reflect upon the tears falling off my cheeks, the thought crossing my mind that perhaps I caused all of the sorrows in her life. 
                        Did she think of me? Did she wish I was there, to hold her; remind her that things would be alright in the end, that we needed to be patient just a little longer? 
                        Did she miss me..? I wonder now if her tears fell the same as mine? Fell off her sweet face and blended into the lapping ocean waves just before she left me. 
                        Now, here I stand, the exact place she once stood; the very site that the night sky would take her breath away, and the daylight would pronounce her dead. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I find myself walking further into the ice-chilled waters of December. 
                        I let the cold surround me, holding me like it held her; take me away, like it took her. 
                        My skin stings as the frigid water slowly flows over my body. 
                        I only want to be with her again, to feel her warm arms around me once more, to kiss her gentle lips again. 
                        Slowly, from the blackness of the water, a sweet sensation surrounds me. 
                        My body, numb and frozen, steadily melts into a blissful warmth, her warmth. 
                        I close my eyes, as the cold water seeps into my lungs, taking me away from my sorrows, and bringing me back to my love, back to her.
