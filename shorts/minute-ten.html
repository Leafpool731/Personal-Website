                                The air was cold and filled with the slightest smell of chlorine. 
                                I stood solemnly as the room fell deadly silent; my heart racing with anxiety. 
                                The pool water lapped noisily against the dirty-white tiled gutters as I waited behind the starting block for the officials to start the event. 
                                Only two hours earlier, my eyes were filled with tears as I drove away from my Dad’s family for the last time. 
                                How was it that I was here, in this swimming meet? 
                                I should be with them before they’re gone away for good before the only way I would ever see them is on my phone screen. 
                                I could feel the pit in my heart grow a little larger when I realized that they would never see me swim another high school meet again, 
                                and would never be in the stands to cheer me on.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The referee walked over to the starter, grabbing the small radio into her hand. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                “Step up girls,” she called in her usual monotone voice. I snapped back into reality, slowly lifting myself onto the block. 
                                Unsteadily, I lowered my body down to gain some sort of balance on the small white platform. <span class="bold-text">For Dad</span>, I thought to myself quietly.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                “Take your mark,” the official sounded, and I tucked my head in between my shoulders to the point where I could see the timers behind me. <span class="em-text bold-text">Beep!</span>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                A second after the tone sounded my feet left the block and my head was in the water. 
                                My dive felt perfect; no part of my body stung with the usual aftermath of a belly flop. 
                                I took my first few strokes, determined to pull myself ahead. 
                                I felt the power inside me as I continued pushing through the water. 
                                Taking my first breath, I saw the young tan girl who swam to my right slowly fall away from me. 
                                I put my face back into the water, watching the shadows of the swimmers around me steadily disappear into the distance as I make my first turn. 
                                I was in the lead, but now I had to keep it.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                My lungs burned as I completed my first fifty yards; my legs begged me to stop using them and just take it easy. 
                                Yet from the screaming crowds of swimmers and parents, I heard something I couldn’t have possibly heard; my father cheering me on. 
                                I pushed myself forward, desperate to make him proud. My body ached with determination as I went in for my final turn. 
                                The last 25 yards… I had to do this, I had to stay strong. So many times I would die out on this length, but not this event, not tonight. 
                                I could hear my coach and team cheering me on as I pass the halfway line on the bottom of the pool; but I only focused on the invisible sounds of my father. 
                                Looking out as I take my last breath there was no one around me; just me, the cold blue water, and the varsity coach screaming at me to go faster. 
                                I whipped my face into the water and sprinted, clawing at the water as if my life depended on it until I reached the dark black touchpad. 
                                My lungs desperately ached for air as I placed my hand onto its smooth, soft surface; my heart racing with both uncertainty and exhaustion.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Looking up at the glowing golden numbers, I couldn’t believe my eyes. 
                                There, written as brightly as the sun is on a hot summer day, was my time: a 1:09.96. 
                                My mouth let out a scream that was more of a screech of pain than a melody of happiness. 
                                I had bested my all time record by two seconds, completed the goal I set out to do since the very first meet. 
                                I look up to where my father usually sat in the stands, to find it empty. 
                                Yet, even though he was now hundreds of miles away, I could see his jubilant eyes and hear his strong clap as I stared into those vacant bleachers. 
                                I had done well, made both him and me proud. 
                                Tears of happiness flowed from my face as I climbed triumphantly out of the water; covering my immense smile with my hand as I walk over to hear my coaches’ congratulations. 
                                I finally broke a minute-ten.
