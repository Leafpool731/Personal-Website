                    <h3>Biography</h3>
                    <p>
                        Elize Haillet was born on the outskirts of the enchanted city of Arcanum, far removed from the opulence and splendor of its central districts. 
                        Her family lived in a modest cottage on the edge of the mystical forests that surrounded the city, 
                        eking out a humble existence away from the bustling streets and towering spires.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        From a young age, Elize displayed an innate talent for potion-making, a skill that set her apart from her peers. 
                        While other children played in the fields and explored the woods, 
                        Elize spent her days poring over alchemical texts and experimenting with ingredients she gathered from the forest.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Elize's family life was fraught with tension and discord. 
                        Her parents, struggling to make ends meet, often argued about money and the family's future. 
                        Feeling overlooked and undervalued, Elize sought solace in her passion for potion-making, finding refuge in the quiet solitude of her makeshift laboratory.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As she continued to hone her skills and pursue her passion for potion-making, 
                        Elize remained determined to prove her worth and forge her own path in the world. 
                        With her brother by her side and her unwavering devotion to her craft, she faced the challenges that lay ahead with courage and resilience, 
                        determined to make her mark on the world of alchemy.

                                        Despite the strained relationship with her parents, Elize shared a special bond with her older brother, Ethan. 
                                        He was the one person who truly understood her and supported her dreams. 
                                        Together, they would spend hours exploring the wonders of the natural world, their shared passion forging a bond that transcended their troubled family dynamic.

                                        As Elize grew older, her devotion to potion-making only deepened. 
                                        She threw herself into her studies with unwavering determination, determined to prove her worth and carve out a place for herself in the world.
                                        Despite her young age, Elize's potions were renowned for their potency and efficacy.

                                        Despite her success as a potion-maker, Elize longed for validation and acceptance from her family. 
                                        She yearned for the day when her parents would see her not as a burden, but as a source of pride. 
                                        In the meantime, she found comfort and strength in the bond she shared with her brother, Ethan, who served as her constant source of encouragement and support.
